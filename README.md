A k means algorithm implementation in Java .Clustering numbers from functions .

# Create dataset putting noise in it :file_folder:

- If (x1 – 0.5)2 + (x2 – 0.5)2 <0.16, then (x1,x2) is classified in the category C1,

- If (x1 + 0.5)2 + (x2 + 0.5)2 <0.16, then (x1,x2) is classified in the category C1,

- If (x1 – 0.5)2 + (x2 + 0.5)2 <0.16, then (x1,x2) is classified in the category C2,

- If (x1 + 0.5)2 + (x2 – 0.5)2 <0.16, then (x1,x2) is classified in the category C2.

We then add noise only to the training set as follows: for each instance of
training set with a probability of 0.1 we change its category and assign it to some random one
another category
