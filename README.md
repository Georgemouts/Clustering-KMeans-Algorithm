# Clustering-K-Means :page_facing_up:
A k means algorithm implementation in Java .Clustering numbers from functions .
UOI-Project for computational intelligence course.

# Create dataset :file_folder:

we generate random points (x1,x2)
in the plane as follows: 
1) 150 points in the square [0.75,1.25]x[0.75,1.25], 
2) 150 points in the square
[0, 0.5]x[0,0.5],
3) 150 points in the square [0,0.5] x [1.5,2], 4) 150 points in the square
[1.5,2]x[0,0.5], 5) 150 points in the square [1.5,2] x [1.5,2], 6) 75 points in the square
[0.6,0.8]x[0,0.4], 7) 75 points in the square [0.6,0.8] x [1.6,2], 8) 75 points in the square
[1.2,1.4]x[0,0.4], 9) 75 points in square [1.2,1.4] x [1.6,2], 10) 150 points in square [0,2]x[0,2].
